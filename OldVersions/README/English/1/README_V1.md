# SeansLifeArchive_MinecraftPE_Backups
The module for my life story project that contains my Minecraft Pocket Edition general backup information.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all my info for my Minecraft Pocket Edition world backups. This project also contains the main note files, and mirrors to download data packs for my 50+ Minecraft Pocket Edition worlds.

## Wiki

[Click/tap here to view this projects Wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_MinecraftPE_Backups/wiki)

If the project has been forked, the Wiki was likely removed. Luckily, I include an embedded version. You can view it [here](/External/ProjectWiki/).

***

## Version history

[Coming soon](https://www.example.com)

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

## Build instructions

### Starter info

Using the world: Windows95MC as an example. All worlds have the same build instructions, but with a different name

Build instructions for GitHub/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_MinecraftPE_Backup_Worlds_Windows95MC\n";

This repository is an archive of all versions of my Minecraft PE world: Windows95MC\n";

Before you can use these worlds, please make sure of the following things:\n";

### Requirements

* That your storage location for Minecraft is set to `external`";

* That your device is running Android (it might work on iOS, but I am not sure)";

* That you are running a matching Minecraft version (a listing of what version each backup is using is listed in another repository";

* That your device has at least 20-512 megabytes of free space, and at least 2 gigabytes of RAM";

### Start

This is a backup of all the versions of the world, according to my journaling structure.";

The worlds are sorted by a monthly ID, starting at 1,July 2019, 2,August 2019, etc... up to 21,March 2021";

To start using the world, locate your device storage and go to: games/com.mojang/MinecraftWorlds/ then cut/copy and paste the directory containing the world code FdAKYKc6AAA= into this folder (you can also use the zip file and extract it) you do not need to remove extra files before running the game, just make sure not to do this while the game is running";

Please also make sure that there is not already another world in your MinecraftWorlds folder labeled Farmtopia.";

### Outro

once installed, you will have a copy of the entire world. You can now change any setting you want, and do whatever you want to the world. If things go wrong, just delete it, and replace the backup";

## Community instructions

There are some plans for this world that I can't do on my own. They include:

* Building actual computers within Minecraft within the world, capable of emulating all Windows versions

* No other community plans at the moment
