Backstory

Cavesystem64 was a test world created when I joined Minecraft again on July 2nd 2019. It was a long struggle to get back into the game.
2 hours after making the world, I found that I could not backup my worlds if the location was set to application. I needed to change it to external, but unfortunately, this would mean all worlds would be erased
Unfortunately, I had to do that. I remade the world, and left it as an archive.
