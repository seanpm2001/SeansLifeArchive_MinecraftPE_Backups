# Mirror list

Welcome to my Minecraft Pocket Edition data pack mirror list. I am trying to make this project friendly to non-programmers, so here is an easier description (putting it in laymans terms as best as I can): a mirror list is a list of download links for downloading the Minecraft data pack you want from sources providing it to you.

Currently, only 1 user is mirroring this project (verified mirrors are listed)
