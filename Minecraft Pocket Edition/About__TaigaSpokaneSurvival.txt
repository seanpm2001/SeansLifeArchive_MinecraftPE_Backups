About: SpokaneTaigaSurvival
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This world is a recreation of an older survival world I had on my old Android phone. This world was originally created around 2015-2017, however I am not 100% sure of the date at the moment.
This world wasn't developed that heavily, as I built it near the end of a car trip to a doctors appointment in Spokane. I only had a few hours to work on it, and on top of that, it was a survival world.
Even though this world didn't get much development, I am very fond of this world. The mix of the snowy Taiga Bay on a trip to Spokane in the winter time.
This was the first world that I have recreated in the process of recreating Minecraft worlds.
Due to recent updates, some things are going to have to be removed, including:
* Moss stone boulders
* Seaweed
I managed to find a location that was almost exact, and recreate the beginning on July 30th 2019 on my 45th Minecraft PE backup.
This world might not take too long to develop, but the memories will be fulfilled again. This is only the first world that I am going to recreate. There are still hundreds to go.
World seed: Taiga Bay
Gamemode: survival
I modified it a little bit, and allowed some cheats, for example, keeping inventory, mob griefing off, fire spreading off, and TNT explosions off.
