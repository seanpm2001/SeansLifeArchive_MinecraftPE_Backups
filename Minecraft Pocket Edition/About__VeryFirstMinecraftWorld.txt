About first iOS world

this was my very first Minecraft pocket edition world, and also my very first Minecraft world
This world was created with Minecraft pocket edition on my old iPod Touch 4th generation back around 2011-2013
I didn't do much in this world, I just explored the world, which was very small at the time. I placed some torches around, and built a small structure
It isn't a very good world, it was mainly just a getting used to Minecraft world. It holds massive significance though. It was created using iOS 4.1

Recreation process:

Some modern blocks need to be removed, such as kelp, etc
The hills need to be raised up more
